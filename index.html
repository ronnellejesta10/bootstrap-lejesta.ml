        	<p>Ronnel Lejesta, I am 25 years old, student and a worker. I live in Sitio Salvacion Tunasan, Muntinlupa City.</p>
        	<p>&nbsp;</p>
        	<p>Our family has five(5) members, my parents and my 2 siblings. My father is already die when I am young, my mother is 56 years old and she worked as a sewer. My eldest sibling is my brother, his worked is at gas station as a supervisor, he has a family with 3 chilren living in Taytay, Rizal. While my second sibling is my sister, working as a call center agent, she also has a family with 2 children but unfortunately her family is at Cavite while her is in Muntinlupa. I am the youngest among our family, I currently living with my long time girlfriend. Aside for being a student, I am also a Merchandiser. I have five(5) dogs, both me and my girlfriend taking care of them. Me and my mother living in the same subdivision but different house.</p>
        	<p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>At my age, we have experience a lot of things in my life and also at work. The most challenging for me is when I need to work while I am high school student to support my needs at school because of a financial problem. That time I am living here in Muntinlupa while my mother is living in Cavite and her salary is not fit to support all my needs. I worked part time at the small restaurant of my neighbor, after class in everyday I work there form 5 pm until 2 pm. After 2 years as a BOY, with the same neighbor they have a Computer Shop here in our subdivision they decided to transfer me as a technician in their shop because they know when I was 15 years old I already know how to fix some computer problems. As of now, even though I am student and have a full time job, if I have extra time I am fixing some phones, laptops and computers. 2019 after graduated my senor high school, I have 2 months break, I decided to apply in a fast food as a service crew. January 2020, I am 1 year college in 2nd semester I stop my study because of financial problem. Last january 2021, I decided to continue my study while I am a student.</p>

        	<h3>My Life Quotes</h3>
            <p>“I dont run away from a challenge because I am afraid. Instead, I run towards it because the only way to escape fear is to trample it beneath your foot.” “Our very survival depends on our ability to stay awake, to adjust to new ideas, to remain vigilant and to face the challenge of change.”  “Embracing each challenge can turn it into a privilege.”</p>
